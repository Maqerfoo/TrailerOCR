# TrailerOCR

This repo contains three branches

The main branch includes:
* IVtext - a dataset of the same baseline-image of synthetic text, warped in different levels over multiple categories.
* A modified evaluation script that accepts matching folders of all filenames for the ground truth and submission.
* A jupyter notebook that can host an interactive heatmap of all parsed results.


The Ubuntu20.04 branch includes all source-code compiled on Ubuntu20.04 and Ubuntu16.04 includes all source code compiled on Ubuntu16.04
